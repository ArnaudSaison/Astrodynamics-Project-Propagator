>The objective of this project is the development of an orbital propagator in the Matlab environment. This propagator should provide a realistic approxi- mation of spacecraft trajectories around the Earth. Eventually, the predictions of your propagator should be compared against the real trajectory of a satellite in low Earth orbit.

# User Guide
## System requirements
- MATLAB R2022a or later
- Aerospace Toolbox
- Warning: some of the codes can take up to several minutes to run.

Others:
- The S3L propagator is required to be placed in a folder named `S3Lprop_v1_21`.
- The SGP4 analytical propagator as provided by S3L must be placed that same folder.
- The file structure should not be changed

## Project
Each question of the project is answered in a separate file:
- `Propagator01_Saison_Montuzet.m` = simple two-body problem for ISS orbit for 24 hours
- `Propagator02_Saison_Montuzet.m` = two-body with J2 perturbation for ISS orbit for 24 hours
- `Propagator03_Saison_Montuzet.m` = two-body with J2 and drag for ISS orbit for 24 hours
- `Propagator04_Saison_Montuzet.m` = two-body with J2 and drag for HST orbit for 24 hours, and SGP4 abalytical propagator

Each file has a corresponding paramters file with the same number identifier.

## Propagator
The propagator requires a parameters structure as generated by `processParam.m`, which requires itself an input paramters structure. No processing should be done before using `processParam.m`. The parameters file must contain:
- Options for perturbations
    - `par.ENABLE_J2` = {1,0} enables/disables J2 perturbation
    - `par.ENABLE_DRAG` =  {1,0} enables/disables drag perturbation using Harris-Priester
- TLE has 2 different modes, both work with only one object to propagate:
    - Give one TLE (three line element) that is used as initial orbit for propgation.
        - `par.TLE.L0` = line 0 the TLE
        - `par.TLE.L1` = line 1 the TLE
        - `par.TLE.L2` = line 2 the TLE
    - Give TLEs in bulk for same object. Initial TLE is used for propagation, followings are plotted for comparison. There should be a `txt` file containing all TLEs (three line elements). 
        - `par.BULKTLES_FILENAME` = \[char vector (uses '', NOT ""), whitout extension name\] file containing all TLEs without additional lines at the end, exactly as download from Space-Track.org
- In order to use SGP4, an additional, specially formatted TLE (two line element in this case) is required. 
    - `par.SGP4TLE_FILENAME` = \[char vector (uses '', NOT ""), whitout extension name\] file containing one TLE
    - `par.SGP4_ECI_MODE` = {1,0} enables/diables use of `tle2eci.m` file that is provided by S3L and does not work properly. Can be used for comparison, but orbit will be incorrect.
- Drag parameters
    - `par.prop.MASS` = \[kg\] mass of object
    - `par.prop.CD` = \[-\] drag coefficient of the object
    - `par.prop.A` = \[m^2\] object area
    - `par.prop.n` = Harris-Priester value for inclination of orbit
- Solver parameters
    - `par.SOLVER` = {ODE45, ODE78, ODE113} solver used for propagation
    - `par.N_STEP` = \[nb\] number of step in the simulation
    - `par.T_END` = \[s\] number of seconds in the simulation
    - `par.REL_TOL` = \[-\] relative tolerance
    - `par.ABS_TOL` = \[-\] absolute tolerance
- `par.DEBUG` = {1,0} enable/diasable additional command window outputs
- Print to PDF feature
    - `par.PRINT_PDF` = {1,0} enable/disable printing figures to PDF in the specified figures folder (WARNING: printing figures to PDF requires about 1 second per figure)
    - `par.PDF_FOLDER` = \[char vector (uses '', NOT "")\] folder in which PDF figures are saved
